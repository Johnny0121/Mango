# Mango

Hi, this is a fun little practice project that I'm doing on-the-side.

## What's Mango

Mango is an equipment inventory management and recipe tracking system designed catered for restaurants! This application will keep track of kitchen equipment, food stocks and food recipes.

Tired of losing that recipe from 3 months back?
- We'll keep ahold of your recipes

Can't remember if you've bought 50 golden-plated spatulas instead of 49
- We'll track that for you too

In a rush to serve a customer a recipe that requires caviar only to find you've forgotten buy some since last week?
- No problemo, we'll email/text you of any food shortages that needs to be bought before it's too late also

## Technologies

This web application is built in ASP.NET Core (3.1) and styled via Bootstrap 6.
