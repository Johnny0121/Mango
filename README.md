# Mango

Hi, this is a fun little practice project that I'm doing on-the-side. My goal is to build a project that will consume any random third party API(s), just for the experience :smiley:

## What's Mango

Mango is an equipment inventory-management and recipe-recording system designed catered for restaurants! This application will keep track of kitchen equipment, food stocks and food recipes.

Tired of losing that recipe from 3 months back?
- We'll keep a hold of your recipes

Can't remember if you've bought 50 gold-plated gucci spatulas instead of 49
- We'll track that for you too

In a rush to serve a customer a recipe that requires caviar only to find you've forgotten buy some since last week?
- No problemo, we'll email/text you of any food shortages that needs to be bought before it's too late also

## Technologies

This web application is built in ASP.NET Core (3.1) and styled via Bootstrap 4.5.
